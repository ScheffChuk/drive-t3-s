# Drive Clone

## TODO


### Folder deletions
- [x] Make sure you fetch all of the folders that have it as a parent, and their children too

### Folder creations
- [x] Make a server action that takes a name and parentId, and creates a folder with that name and parentId (don't forget to set the ownerId).

### Access control
- [x] Check if user is owner before showing the folder page.

### Make a "file view" page
- [ ] You get the idea. Maybe check out my last tutorial?

### Toasts!


### Gray out a row while it's being deleted
- [x] Disabled click when a row is being deleted
